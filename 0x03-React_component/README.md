This project focuses on understanding and implementing React components, which are the building blocks of a React application. It covers the creation of functional and class components, the use of component state and lifecycle methods, and how to compose components to build complex user interfaces. By the end of this project, developers will gain hands-on experience in structuring React applications, managing component hierarchies, and leveraging props and state to enhance interactivity and user experience.
